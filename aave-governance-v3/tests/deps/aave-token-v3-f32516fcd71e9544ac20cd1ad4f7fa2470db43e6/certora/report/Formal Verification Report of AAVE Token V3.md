# Formal Verification Report of AAVE Token V3

## Summary

This document describes the specification and verification of AAVE Token V3 using the Certora Prover. The work was undertaken from July 15th to August 10th, 2022. The latest commit reviewed and run through the Certora Prover was [8bb9f896](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-token-v3/commit/8bb9f8966991f8225adbce2b5cd38b5ae3612ecd).

The scope of this verification is AAVE token V3 code which includes the following contracts:

* `AaveV3Token.sol`


And its parent contracts:

* `BaseAaveToken.sol`
* `BaseAaveTokenV2.sol`

This project has been a part of a joint Certora and Aave community program. Contributors from the community have conducted independent formal verification of the code, where Certora has provided an initial setup for writing a specification. 

19 out of the 25 community participants submitted spec files containing formal specifications resulting in 275 properties in total. Out of the 275 correctness rules, 240 quality rules passed our professional review and credited their authors with grants. 

Selected rules written by the community are included in this report in the [_Community_](#Community) section.

Certora also performed a manual audit of these contracts.

During this verification process, the Certora Prover discovered issues in the code which are listed in the tables below.

All the rules and specification files are publicly available and can be found in [AAVE Token V3 repository](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-token-v3/tree/certora/certora).

| Issue:            | Precision loss during voting power transfer |
| --------          | -------- | 
| Description:      | When calculating delegated balance on token transfer, the new delegated balance of a delegate was calculated with a small precision loss that violated the property $$delegatee1Power_{t1} = delegatee1Power_{t0} - z / 10^{10} * 10^{10}$$ after a delegator to delegatee1 transfers z amount of tokens.
|Property Violated: | vpTransferWhenOnlyOneIsDelegating (Property #6) and others        |
| AAVE Response:| The issue was fixed in commit [a287d134](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-token-v3/commit/a287d134903618bed5671d411c66641bfd96002b) and the relevant property was modified to be     $$delegatee1Power_{t1} = delegatee1Power_{t0} - account1Balance_{t0} / 10^{10} * 10^{10} + account1Balance_{t1} / 10^{10} * 10^{10}$$

# Summary of Formal Verification

## Overview of the AAVE Token V3

`AaveV3Token.sol` is the main contract. It inherits from `BaseAaveToken.sol` and `BaseAaveTokenV2.sol`.

The following description is taken from the token [repository](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-token-v3/blob/main/properties.md):

AAVE is an ERC20 token deployed on Ethereum, which main utility is participating in the Aave governance system via voting on proposals or creating them.

AAVE is a transparent proxy contract, and its current [implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc13eac3b4f9eed480045113b7af00f7b5655ece8#code) is version 2.

Together with all the standard ERC20 functionalities, the current implementation includes extra logic mainly for the management and accounting of voting and proposition power. Due to the design/architecture of the Aave governance v2 system, of which AAVE is the main voting asset, the current AAVE implementation makes the token transfers quite gas-consuming, as multiple snapshots of data (voting and proposition power) need to be stored all the time.

With a new iteration of the Aave governance in the Aave/BGD roadmap down the line, snapshots on the token will not be required anymore for its integration with the governance system. So this new version 3 of AAVE consists mainly of removing the snapshotting, together with adding extra minor meta-transactions capabilities.

## Assumptions and Simplifications Made During Verification



The invariants in `general.spec` were proven on a slightly modified version of the token code. To bypass a current limitation of the Certora prover, we've refactored the `delegationState` field of the `_balances` struct to be a `uint8` instead of a `DelegationState` enum type. The `AaveV3Token.sol` code was modified to accomodate this change.

These changes can be seen in the [patch file](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-token-v3/blob/certora/certora/applyHarness.patch) in the Certora branch of the token repository.

To create this harness, we run `make munged` command from the `certora` directory (on the `certora` branch). 

- We unroll loops. Violations that require a loop to execute more than twice will not be detected.

## Notations

‚úîÔ∏è indicates the rule is formally verified on the latest reviewed commit. We write ‚úîÔ∏è* when the rule was verified on the simplified assumptions described above in "Assumptions and Simplifications Made During Verification".

‚ùå indicates the rule was violated under one of the tested versions of the code.


üîÅ indicates the rule is timing out.

Our tool uses Hoare triples of the form {p} C {q}, which means that if the execution of program C starts in any state satisfying p, it will end in a state satisfying q. This logical structure is reflected in the included formulae for many of the properties below. Note that p and q here can be thought of as analogous to `require` and `assert` in Solidity. 

The syntax {p} (C1 ÔΩû C2) {q} is a generalization of Hoare rules, called relational properties. {p} is a requirement on the states before C1 and C2, and {q} describes the states after their executions. Notice that C1 and C2 result in different states. As a special case, C1 ÔΩûop C2, where op is a getter, indicating that C1 and C2  result in states with the same value for op.

Our tool consists of a special struct type variable called environment, usually denoted by e. This complex type includes the various block data context accessible by solidity (e.g. block.timestamp, msg.sender, msg.value etc.)
These fields are accessible via the environment variable.

### ERC20 Properties

21. **transferCorrect** ‚úîÔ∏è
Token transfer works correctly. Balances are updated if not reverted. 
If reverted then the transfer amount was too high, or the recipient is 0.
```
    {
        balanceFromBefore = balanceOf(msg.sender)
        balanceToBefore = balanceOf(to)
    }
    <
        transfer(to, amount)
    >
    {
        lastReverted => to = 0 || amount > balanceOf(msg.sender)
        !lastReverted => balanceOf(to) = balanceToBefore + amount &&
                        balanceOf(msg.sender) = balanceFromBefore - amount
    }
```

22. **transferFromCorrect** ‚úîÔ∏è
Token transferFrom function works correctly. Balances are updated if not reverted.  If reverted then the transfer amount was too high, or the recipient is 0, or the allowance was not sufficient
```
    {
        balanceFromBefore = balanceOf(from)
        balanceToBefore = balanceOf(to)
    }
    <
        transferFrom(from, to, amount)
    >
    {
        lastreverted => to = 0 || amount > balanceOf(from)
        !lastreverted => balanceOf(to) = balanceToBefore + amount &&
                        balanceOf(from) = balanceFromBefore - amount
    }
```

23. **zeroAddressNoBalance** ‚úîÔ∏è
Balance of address 0 is always 0
```
{ balanceOf(0) = 0 }
```

24. **NoChangeTotalSupply** ‚úîÔ∏è
Contract calls don't change token total supply.
```
    {
        supplyBefore = totalSupply()
    }
    < f(e, args)>
    {
        supplyAfter = totalSupply()
        supplyBefore == supplyAfter
    }
```

25. **ChangingAllowance** ‚úîÔ∏è
Allowance changes correctly as a result of calls to approve, transfer, increaseAllowance, decreaseAllowance
```
    {
        allowanceBefore = allowance(from, spender)
    }
    <
        f(e, args)
    >
    {
        f.selector = approve(spender, amount) => allowance(from, spender) = amount
        f.selector = transferFrom(from, spender, amount) => allowance(from, spender) = allowanceBefore - amount
        f.selector = decreaseAllowance(spender, delta) => allowance(from, spender) = allowanceBefore - delta
        f.selector = increaseAllowance(spender, delta) => allowance(from, spender) = allowanceBefore + delta
        generic f.selector => allowance(from, spender) == allowanceBefore
    }
```

26. **TransferSumOfFromAndToBalancesStaySame** ‚úîÔ∏è
Transfer from msg.sender to b doesn't change the sum of their balances
```
    {
        balancesBefore = balanceOf(msg.sender) + balanceOf(b)
    }
    <
        transfer(b, amount)
    >
    {
        balancesBefore == balanceOf(msg.sender) + balanceOf(b)
    }
```

27. **TransferFromSumOfFromAndToBalancesStaySame** ‚úîÔ∏è
transferFrom from a to b doesn't change the sum of their balances
```
    {
        balancesBefore = balanceOf(a) + balanceOf(b)
    }
    <
        transferFrom(a, b)
    >
    {
        balancesBefore == balanceOf(a) + balanceOf(b)
    }
```

28. **TransferDoesntChangeOtherBalance** ‚úîÔ∏è
Transfer from msg.sender to alice doesn't change the balance of other addresses
```
    {
        balanceBefore = balanceOf(charlie)
    }
    <
        transfer(alice, amount)
    >
    {
        balanceOf(charlie) == balanceBefore
    }
```

29. **TransferFromDoesntChangeOtherBalance** ‚úîÔ∏è
```
    {
        balanceBefore = balanceOf(charlie)
    }
    <
        transferFrom(alice, bob, amount)
    >
    {
        balanceOf(charlie) = balanceBefore
    }
```

30. **OtherBalanceOnlyGoesUp** ‚úîÔ∏è
Balance of an address, who is not a sender or a recipient in transfer functions, doesn't decrease as a result of contract calls
```
    {
        balanceBefore = balanceOf(charlie)
    }
    <
        f(e, args)
    >
    {
        f.selector != transfer && f.selector != transferFrom => balanceOf(charlie) == balanceBefore
